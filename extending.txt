each station's logic is almost 100% independent
the only exception are trigger flags
any station can be duplicated and it's number incremented to create a copy
filters above triggers are tied to the flag at that station
any station that receives multiple ingredients may need multiple triggers so each can target the flag to reset it

afaik it's not possible to target the player and ForceDrop the flag, this would be ideal
triggers, even those specifically targetting players do not appear to target the flags
capturing the flag would solve this, if not for messing up the gamemode by skewing scores
it could be possible to avoid any abuse of some system like this by giving finished dishes a higher value
however fast flag reset times and a more granular score would likely detract from the focus of delivering complete meals

this might be worth trying, but time is limited

a simple approach to multi-flag setups would be incredibly useful

alternatives include, cycling filters on a timer via fireuser
e.g. OnFireUser1 !self AddOutput filtername mgX_filter_...
does !self require the entity to have a targetname / unique targetname?

not having to disable alternate triggers would also be awesome
